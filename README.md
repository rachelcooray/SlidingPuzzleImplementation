# Sliding Puzzle Solver

This project implements a sliding puzzle solver using the A* algorithm. The solver reads a grid map from a text file, processes it into a graph, finds a path from the start point (S) to the finish point (F), and prints the path along with the time taken to complete the solution.

## Introduction

Sliding Puzzle Solver is a Java application designed to solve sliding puzzles using the A* algorithm. 
The application reads puzzle configurations from a text file, identifies the start and end points, and computes the shortest path to solve the puzzle.

## Features

- Parses puzzle configuration from a text file
- Uses A* algorithm to find the shortest path from start to finish
- Prints the puzzle configuration, start and end points, and the solution steps
- Displays the time taken to find the solution
